# Pathfinding-in-2d-using-Navmesh-of-UNity3D

Unity has a simple way to create a pathfinding system for your objects. This easy process will allow you to get your basic AI off the ground quickly and allow you to create a more complex AI from there. In this example you’ll be creating a navigation mesh that an object will use to make its way to several points that you place in the environment. You will craft an area that you can ‘bake’ a navigation mesh in to start, create an object, and give the object a script that it will use to travel to different waypoints. From there you will set up these waypoints and assign them to the object in order to create a path for your object to follow endlessly.
